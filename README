It's 2015 and I still love listening to radio. But seeing I suck time management I often miss my favorite auditions.

This simple hack will turn HTML schedule from Polskie Radio's website into a ICS I can stick into my calendar.

If you're too lazy to run it by yourself put https://fuse.pl/pr/Jedynka.ics (Dwojka.ics, Trojka.ics, Czworka.ics, RadioPoland.ics, PR24.ics) into your calendaring application.
